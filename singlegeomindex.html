		When generating a 3x3 cube, browser seems to take around 5 seconds to generate everything
		upon first launch, and then around 2 seconds on average to load everything when refreshed.
		Maybe there is some sort of cache involved? (Considering longest load time is when first
		loaded in new browser session.) The TextGeometry always takes a fraction of a second
		longer to generate than the icosahedron geometries, so text gets loaded last.
		An important thing to note about these icosahedron geometries is that they are all
		individually generated geometries (this is the only way I know how to give different
		colors to the geometry faces at the moment), rather than being the same geometry
		pushed into each individual mesh.

		There is also some frame dropping immediately after loading all of the gemoetries,
		but it seems to smooth out within a few seconds.

		No frame drops when another scene is opened in a new tab, but frames do drop when
		a scene is opened in a new window.

		TODO: Problem with canvas resizing. Scenes loads centered properly in canvas at first.
		When web console is opened, the full width of the page is extended and the canvas is extended accordingly,
		but within the visible frame the scene looks shifted to the right. When the web console is closed,
		the page keeps this width.
